          By accessing and using this website, you are acknowledging and agreeing to
          the following terms and conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gitcoin Inc. (Gitcoin) is the creator of downtownstimulus.com and acts
          solely as the provider of the user interface for a donation between you and
          the local business that you donate to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Neither Gitcoin nor DowntownStimulus.com takes any processing fees from
          donations made on this platform or from matching donation funds.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          All funds are sent directly to the businesses. Downtown Stimulus does not,
          at any time, have access to any funds submitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Downtown Stimulus does not, at any time, handle your credit card info. All
          payment software and services is provided by Stripe, a third party service
          provider. The matching $30,000 fund is held by Boulder’s Downtown
          Partnership 501(c)6, and will distribute the matching funds to each
          business at the end of the round.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gitcoin and Downtownstimulus.com does not facilitate or provide any
          donation receipts or tax deduction documentations.

        <li>
          You agree to release, indemnify on demand and hold Gitcoin and its
          affiliates and their officers, employees, directors and agents harmless
          from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
          fees, costs, awards, fines, damages, rights, claims, actions of any kind
          and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the
          services, any donation, any user content, your connection to the services,
          your violation of these terms or your violation of any rights of another.
          You agree that Gitcoin has the right to conduct its own defense of any
          claims at its own discretion, and that you will indemnify Gitcoin for the
          costs of its defense (including, but not limited to attorney’s fees.) If
          you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section
          1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims that the
          creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her
          favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by him or her
          would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or
          released party." If you are a resident of another jurisdiction—in or
          outside of the United States—you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

          PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, (B) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, (C) DAMAGES
          FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, (D) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, (E) LOSS OR CORRUPTION
          OF DATA, OR (F) OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF GITCOIN HAS BEEN ADVISED
          OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
          NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM (I) THE USE OR
          THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES.

            When you interact with Downtown Stimulus through the Services, we
            automatically receive and store certain information from devices that you
            use to access the Services. This information is collected passively by
            using various technologies, and includes the type of internet browser or
            mobile device you use, any website from which you have come to the
            Services, your operating system, and location data through an IP address
            that identifies the city and state where you logged into the Platform or
            your precise geo-location if you have permitted your mobile device to
            provide that information to us. Downtown Stimulus either stores such
            information itself or such information is included in databases owned and

            simple and meaningful. When you visit our Platform, our web server, third
            party business providers, and/or the social networking services
            integrated into the Service, use cookies or other electronic technologies
            (such as web beacons or pixel tags) for various purposes. Cookies are
            small pieces of information that are issued to your computer or mobile
            device when you visit a website or access or use a mobile application,
            and that store and sometimes track information about your use of the
            Platform. Web beacons are transparent image files, which enable the
            Platform to track website usage information. Unlike cookies, web beacons
            are not placed on your computers. Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with
            unique identifiers that track online movements of our users. Unlike
            cookies, pixel tags are embedded in web pages. We will refer to the
            cookies and other technologies identified here as Cookies for purposes of
            this Policy.

              Type of Cookies
              <br />
              Some Cookies are strictly necessary to make our Services available to
              you (“Essential cookies”). For example, to provide the chat and login
              functionality and to remember your consent and privacy choices. We
              cannot provide our Services without these Essential Cookies. We also
              use Cookies for functional purposes in order to maintain and improve
              our Services or improve your experiences, and for marketing purposes
              (collectively “Non-Essential Cookies”). Some of the Non-Essential
              Cookies used are set by us, to collect and process certain data on our
              behalf, and some are set by third parties and our Social Networking
              Services.

              Information to and from Social Networking Services
              <br />
              Non-essential Cookies include Cookies we use in conjunction with the
              Social Networking Services. One of the special features of the Services
              is that it allows you to enable or log into the Services via various
              social networking services like Facebook or Twitter, or upload videos
              using YouTube APIs ("Social Networking Service(s)"). By directly
              integrating these services, we aim to make your online experiences
              richer and more personalized. To take advantage of these features, we
              will ask you to provide your credentials for the applicable Social
              Networking Service in order to log in to our Services. When you add a
              Social Networking Services account to the Services or log into the
              Services using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect
              relevant information necessary to enable the Services to access that
              Social Networking Service. As part of such integration, the Social
              Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information
              that you have provided to the Social Networking Service (for example,
              your name and photograph, as well as other information that you permit
              the Social Networking Service to share with us).

        <b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
        <li>
          This Policy applies only to the Services. The Services can contain links to
          other web sites not operated or controlled by Downtown Stimulus (the
          "Third-Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here do not
          apply to the Third-Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply
          that Downtown Stimulus endorses or has reviewed the Third-Party Sites. We
          suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their respective
          privacy policies.

        <b>SECURITY</b>
        <li>
          Downtown Stimulus has implemented technical and organizational security
          measures to protect the information provided via the Services from loss,
          misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
          For example, limiting access to information only to employees and
          authorized service providers who need to know such information for the
          purposes described in this Policy. However, no Internet or email
          transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent
          to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take
          special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please
          keep this in mind when disclosing any information to Downtown Stimulus via
          the Internet.
